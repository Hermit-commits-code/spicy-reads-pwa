My Ex-Boyfriend's Brothers: A Contemporary Reverse Harem Romance (Ex Marks the Spot),Rebel Bloom,,B0DKZNNCH3,Romance,Romance-Comedy,Ex Marks the Spot,1,,"Getting over your ex by getting under someone new is normal.
Getting with your ex's three brothers while planning his wedding? That's next-level chaos.

I'm Maggie, and according to my ex, I'll never be ""perfect"" enough. Too curvy, too messy, too… me. So when he asks me to plan his wedding, I should've said no. Instead, my bank account screamed yes—and now I'm stuck planning his perfect day alongside his three sinfully HOT older brothers.

There's Jackson, the tattooed bad boy whose touch makes my common sense vanish. Luke, the broody billionaire who gets everything he wants. And Ryan, the globe-trotting charmer whose dimpled grin makes me burn up in places that would scandalize the mother-of-the-bride.

I swore I'd keep things professional. Really, I did. But when Jackson pins me against the venue wall, Luke's late-night meetings turn unprofessional, and Ryan's pre-wedding photoshoot ends with me in my birthday suit... Let's just say my ex's wedding is the least of my problems. Between hiding hickeys from my ex, becoming besties with his bride-to-be, and trying to remember which brother left which mark, I'm in way over my head.

And if my groom-zilla ex finds out? I could lose more than just my career—I could lose the three men who finally make me feel like I'm everything.

My Ex-Boyfriend's Brothers is a steamy reverse harem rom-com with enough heat to melt the wedding cake before it hits the table. HEA guaranteed! ",,,,,,,09/25/25

My Ex-Best Friends: A Spicy Contemporary Reverse Harem Romance (Ex Marks the Spot)",Rebel Bloom,,B0DT2B9CGC,Romance,Romance-Comedy,Ex Marks the Spot,2,,"Running from the altar in a wedding dress? Not exactly how I pictured my big day.
But crashing back into the lives of my ex-best friends? That’s where the real trouble begins.

Colt, Noah, and Logan weren’t just my best friends—they were my whole damn world. Oh, and the ones who got my V-card in one unforgettable night. Then I ran, leaving them behind with nothing but questions and broken trust. When the guys find out I ditched my cheating ex at the altar, they make an offer: they’ll coach me on how to date someone who deserves me.

Logan, with that panty-dropping smirk, gives me lessons on how to use my hips on the dance floor—lessons that end with us tangled in the back of his truck.

Noah, the golden boy single dad with muscles for days, reminds me exactly how his touch can undo me when we’re “building my profile.”

And Colt? Dark, broody, and built like a tank, sets me up on a blind date only to scare the guy so bad he leaves skid marks in the parking lot.

Somewhere between steamy “practice” sessions and the lines we swore we wouldn’t cross, I realize these three men might be the best thing I ever ran from. But when buried truths surface and betrayals cut deep, the question isn’t just whether I’ll stop running—it’s whether my heart can survive staying.

My Ex-Best Friends is a steamy standalone reverse harem rom-com with laugh-out-loud moments, second chance charm, and spice hotter than a jalapeño. HEA guaranteed!

I went from college royalty to campus outcast the second my quarterback boyfriend dumped me—and now I’m stuck living with his ex-roommates who hate my guts.

To them, I’m the spoiled princess who ruined their season when Jake bailed to another team. But I’m no princess. I clawed my way up from nothing, and I’m not about to let these three bring me to my knees.

Silas Turner—the rough, tattooed brute with a past as jagged as his jawline. He’s made it his mission to break me, and damn if I don’t like the way he tries.

Dylan Cooper—team captain, reluctant quarterback, and the only thing holding this team together. He plays by the rules—except when it comes to me.

I hate them. They hate me. But we all want revenge on my ex. When they see I know my way around a playbook, we strike a deal—I save their season, and maybe they'll let me stay.

I’m juggling boozy brunches, spa days turned mud fights, and wedding dress disasters—while dodging lingering touches, whispered promises, and a jealous wedding planner who might actually want me dead. I’m not exactly winning Maid of Honor of the Year.

What if I’m not their second chance at love, just the prize they’re fighting over?
